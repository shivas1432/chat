Running the Application
Frontend
To start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will run the frontend and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend
To start the backend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will run the backend server, typically on http://localhost:5000 (or another specified port).

Building for Production
To create a production build of the application:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will optimize the app for the best performance and create a build folder containing the production-ready files.

Deployment
For deployment, follow these steps:

Run npm run build to generate the production build.
Deploy the contents of the build folder to your preferred hosting service.
Ensure your backend server is deployed and accessible.
